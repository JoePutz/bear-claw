# Bear Claw Edit Page
> A form to allow users of Bear Claws' Talent Engagement System to update their profiles

## Getting Started

This is a simple React application, and should be opened with 
```sh
npm start
```

## Using the App

The fields and buttons should all be working. A few points on the useage of this product: 

-A finished Edit Profile Page should have the user's earlier options pre-filled and stored in the formData. But since there was no initial user this is ignored. On a finished product upon the loging in of the user the required information would be used to fill out the various inputs. 

-Importing a profile photo is done through clicking on the camera icon. But it would not normally be added into the actual profile section until the form is submitted. Please isntead enjoy the same wonderful picture of Mr Rick Astley you snuck onto the original test image. 

## Thank You

I hope you find the form acceptable and think of me when deciding who gets to the next step in the process.
